A dumb text-based adventure game played in the terminal. 

This is a really, really, really simple game I made for APCSP Create Performance Task. Yes I took APCSP (exam only) in ninth grade (2025). 

I spent way too much time on this. Well I mean a few hours is way too much time to be spending on just an AP assignment, am I wrong?  
Also I like keeping stuff so I might as well keep this here. 

Play this if you're interested, but I don't have an .exe file bc idk how to make one D:
